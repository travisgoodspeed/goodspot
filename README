goodspot, a SPOT Connect client for the Nokia N9
by Travis Goodspeed

This is presently just a proof of concept, hardwired to transmit only
OK messages and to transmit them toward the first receiver group.

If you are trying to learn the SPOT Connect's protocol, try my
py-bluez client [1].  The original SPOT was reverse engineered by
Alexei Karpenko in [2], which is a damned good article.
